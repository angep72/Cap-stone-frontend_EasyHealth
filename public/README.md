# Public Assets

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Vite.

## Background Image

To add a custom background image for the landing page:

1. Place your image file in this `public/` folder (e.g., `background.jpg`, `hero-image.png`)
2. The image should be:
   - High resolution (1920x1080 or larger recommended)
   - Healthcare/medical themed (doctors, hospitals, medical equipment, etc.)
   - Optimized for web (compressed, under 500KB if possible)
3. Update the image path in `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` if you use a different filename
